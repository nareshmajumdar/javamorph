## Call ##

java -jar JavaMorph\_2009\_01\_19.jar

## Install and Run under WINDOWS XP up to WINDOWS 8 ##

a) Download JAVAMORPH as a `*`.jar archive.

b) Open http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/ and chose your WINDOWS hardware version of the JAVA-interpreter: either "x86" for older 32 bit PCs or "x64" for modern 64 bit PCs.

c) Execute the installer of the JAVA interpreter by double click on the `*`.exe file (either jre-7u45-windows-i586.exe or jre-7u45-windows-x64.exe).

d) Open the DESKTOP under WINDOWS 8 by click on the app-icon. In older Windows versions the desktop is the default. Right-click on the task-bar at the bottom of the screen and open the task-manager. Click on "More details"->File->New Task->Enter "cmd". The DOS-BOX will appear.

e) In the DOS-Box: Enter "java -version" to verify that the JAVA interpreter has been successfully installed. Now change to the directory where you have downloaded javamorph (typically: "cd c:\users\`<`username`>`\Downloads\"). Enter: **java -jar JavaMorph\_2010\_02\_01.jar** to start javamorph.

f) Confirm the creation of the working directory and wait for the graphical window which appears. Make a right mouse double-click on the background and chose "Morph". The two faces will be morphed and you can find the result within the working directory (typically on c:\users\`<`username`>`\Desktop\JavaMorph\output, e.g. the JavaMorph/output/ folder on the Desktop). In some languages a Desktop folder is present under another name. Then you have to create a new folder which is explicitly named "Desktop".
